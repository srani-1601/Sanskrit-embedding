When Şītā, having a husband although seeming as if she had none, was putting on the ascetic guise, the people got into a wrath and exclaimed, “O Dasaratha, fie on you!"
Aggrieved at the uproar that arose there in consequence, the lord of earth banished from his heart all regard for life, virtue, and fame. And sighing hot, that descendant of Ikşvāku spoke to that wife of his, saying, O Kaikeyi, Sītā deserves not to go in a Kuća dress.
Tender, and youthful, and worthy of happiness, she is by no means capable of living in the forest. My spiritual guide has spoken the truth.
Whom has this one injured that, being the daughter of the foremost of kings, she like a female ascetic, wearing a meagre garb in the presence of all, will (repair to the woods and) remain there like a beggar destitute of everything?
Let Janaka's daughter leave off her ascetic guise. This is not the promise that I had made to you before. Let the princess go to the forest in comfort, furnished with all sorts of gems.
My sands run out; by me has this cruel promise been made with an oath. But this (exile of Sītä) has been thought of by you through your ignorance. Let it not, however, consume you like a bamboo flower destroying the bamboo.
If, O wicked woman, Rāma has happened to do you something unbeautiful, what wrong, O base wretch, has Vaidehi done you in the world?
Of eyes expanded like those of a doe, endued with a mild temperament, and virtuous, what harm has Janaka's daughter done you.
Surely, O nefarious one, the banishment of Ráma is enough for you. Why then do you bend your mind to perpetrate these atrocious sins?
O noble dame, having heard you asking for the banishment of Rāma, who had at first been intended by me for being installed, and who came here afterwards, I had promised you (his exile alone.)
But since, going beyond that promise of mine, you behold Mithala's daughter dressed in mendicant garb, surely you wish to find your way to hell.
Thus commissioned to the forest, Räma who was seated sealing his lips, said.
O righteous one, this my mother is aged and famous and of lofty spirit. May she not meet with improper treatment at your hands! It behoves you, O bestower of boons, to show greater honour to her when she shall be deprived of me and be plunged into a sea of grief and afflicted with unprecedented woe.
O you comparable to the mighty Indra, you should so behove with my mother smitten with my separation, that exercised by grief in consequence of my residence in the forest, she may not, renouncing life, repair to the mansions of Yama.
Hearing those bold words of the ascetic, the son of that foremost of men, Rāghava firm in his vows, with clasped hands answered.
In accordance with the desire of my sire, and in order to glorify it, I ought fearlessly to do even as Kusika's son says. And having been desired to that end while at Ayodhyā by that high-souled one, my father Dasaratha, in the midst of the spiritual guides, I ought not to pass by your words.
Therefore, commanded by that upholder of the Veda, I, agreeably to my father's mandate, will, without doubt, bring about that welcome event-the death of Tataka.
And in the interests of Brāhmaṇas, kine, and celestials, I am ready to act as desired by you of immeasurable energy.
Having said this, that repressor of foes, with clenched fist, twanged his bow-string, filling the ten cardinal points with the sounds. And at those sounds, the dwellers in Tāțakā's forest were filled with perturbation, and Tātakā also amazed at those sounds, became exceedingly wroth.
And rendered almost insensible by anger, that Räksasī furiously rushed in a main towards the spot whence had come the report.
And beholding that frightful one of hideous visage and colossal proportions, transported with rage, Raghu's descendant spoke to Laksmana,9
Behold, O Laksmana, the terrible and hideous body of yonder Yakṣiṇī! The sight of her strike terror into the hearts of even the brave.
Mark! This irrepressible one, possessing all the resources of illusion, will I oppose, and deprive her of ears and nose.
But I dare not slay her, she being protected by virtue of her feminineness. I intend only to oppose her course, and deprive her of her prowess.
As Rāma was speaking thus, Tāțakā, deprived of sense through ire, uttering roars, with uplifted arms rushed against him.
And thereat the Brahmarsi, Visvāmitra, uttering a roar, upbraided her, and said, Svasti!* May victory attend the descendants of Raghu! *A particle of benediction, indeclinable.
And raising thick clouds of dust, Tāțakā instantly bewildered both the descendants of Raghu.
And then by help of illusion, she began to pour upon them a mighty shower of crags. And thereat Raghu's descendant was wroth.
And resisting that mighty shower of crags by vollies of shafts, Rāghava with arrows cut off her hands.
And with the fore-parts of her arms lopped off, as she was roaring before them, Sumitra's son waxing wroth deprived her of her ears and nose.
Thereupon that one capable of assuming forms at will, began to assume various shapes; and to vanish from sight, bewildering her antagonists with her illusory displays.
Terribly ranging the field, the Yakṣī showered crags upon her antagonists. And beholding them enveloped on all sides by that craggy downpour, the auspicious son of Gadhi spoke these words-O Rāma, renounce your antipathy. This one of wicked ways is exceedingly impious. And this sacrifice-disturbing Yakși will, by virtue of her power of illusion, come to increase more and more in energy. Do you, therefore, against the arrival of dusk, slay her! The Rākṣasas are incapable of being controlled when evening sets in.
Thus addressed, Rāma, displaying his skill in aiming by sounds, enveloped with arrows that Yakṣī showering crags.
Being thus hemmed in with a network of shafts, she possessed of the powers of illusion, rushed against Kākutstha and Lakşmaņa, uttering terrible roars. And as that Yaksi, in prowess like to a thunder-bolt, was rushing on, Rāma pierced her chest with arrows, and thereat she dropped down and died.
Upon seeing that grim-visaged one slain, the lord of the celestials together with the celestials themselves honouring Kākutstha, exclaimed Well, Well!.
And exceedingly pleased, the thousand-eyed Purandara, together with the delighted deities, said to Viśvāmitra.
O ascetic, O Kusika's son, good betide you! all the Maruts with Indra at their head, have been gratified with this act (of Rāma's). Do you, O Brāhmaṇa, confer upon Raghu's descendant the sons of Prajāpati Kțśāśva, of true prowess, and charged with ascetic energy.
And ever following you, he, O Brāhmaṇa, is fit to receive them of you. And this son of the king is to accomplish a mighty task in the interests of the celestials.
Saying this, the deities, having paid homage to Viśvāmitra, joyfully entered the celestial regions.
And now came evening on, when that best of ascetics, gratified at the destruction of Tāțakā, smelt Rāma's crown and said these words,
Here, O Rāma of gracious presence, shall we pass the night; and morrow morning, went to that hermitage of mine.
Hearing Visvāmitra's words, Dasaratha's son, glad at heart, happily passed that night in the forest of Tāțakā.
And being thus freed from all disturbances, from that day forth that forest appeared charming, even like to the forest of Caitraratha.
Having thus slain the Yakşa's daughter, Rāma, eulogised by celestials and Siddhas, spent there that night with the saint, being awakened by the latter at the break of day.
Thereupon the high-souled Rāma, along with Sugrīva, proceeded from the mount Rșyamuka to Kiskindha, maintained by Vali's prowess, raising up his gold crested mighty bow and taking his battle arrows like to Aditya.
The mighty Sugrīva, bending low, proceeded before the high-souled Rama and Laksmana.
They were followed by the heroic Hanumān, the mighty Nala and Neela, and the highly powerful Tārā, the leader of the monkey herd.
They beheld as they proceeded, trees, lowered down with the weight of flowers, rivers of clear water flowing to the ocean, mountain hollows, hills, caves, cavities, and principal peaks and charming rills.
They. beheld on their way, pools filled with water clear as Baidurya and beautified with lotuses-full blown and buds, and resounded with the cries of Kārandhabas, swans, geese, Banculas, water-fowls, Cakravākas, and various other birds.
They surveyed all around in the forest-land, deer ranging fearlessly at large and grazing on tender grass.
They beheld frightful wild elephants having white teeth, ranging alone-the destroyers of river banks and enemies of pools. And observing many an infuriated monkey like to elephants, resembling so many moveable mountains riving the mountainous expanses crusted with dust, and many other wild beasts and birds the followers of Sugrīva wended their way.
They proceeding quickly, Rama, the descendant of Raghu, beholding the forest filled with trees, spoke to Sugrīva, saying.
These trees skirted by plantain groves, dense as a collection of clouds, appear as clouds in the sky. Great is my curiosity, O friend, to learn what are these. 'And I wish to have my curiosity removed by you.
Hearing the words of the high-souled Rāghava, Sugrīva began to describe that great forest.
In this extensive asylum, O Rāghava, removing the toil (of the travellers) filled with gardens and trees and abounding in delicious fruits, roots and water, dwelt seven Saints, having control over their senses. Those seven Saints, dwelling on the mountain, passed days and nights in water with their heads down and after seven nights used to live upon air. In this wise, passing seven hundred years they repaired bodily to heaven.
By virtue of their asceticism, this asylum is walled by trees and incapable of being conquered even by Indra, the celestials and the Asuras.
Birds or other wild animals do not enter this asylum; whoever entereth this by mistake never returneth.
There is audible, O Rāghava, the sound of the dressing of Apsarās, their sweet-winged accents and that of their music and drums; and herçin pervadeth the celestial fragrance.
Here burneth the fire Tretā; and the smoke and cloud sable like to the wings of a pigeon envelope the tops of the trees.
And there appear the trees, having their tops saturated with smoke and cloaked with clouds, like to so many Baidurya hills.
Do you, O Rāghava, O virtuous-souled one, make obeisance to them along with your brother Lakṣmaṇa, with concentrated heart and folded palms.
There resteth no sin in their persons, O Rāma, who bow to those self-controlled Saints.
Thereupon Rāma, along with his younger brother Lakşmaņa, made obeisance to those high-souled ones.
Having paid homage (to the sacred memory of those great ones) the virtuous-souled Rāma his (younger) brother Laksmana, Sugriva and other monkeys, proceeded with delighted hearts.
And wending a distant way from that hermitage of the seven great ones, they beheld Kişkindhä, hard to conquer and occupied by Vali.
Thereupon, Rāma, his younger brother and the monkeys taking their weapons, entered, to encompass the destruction of their enemies, the city (of Kişkindhā) reared by the prowess of Indra's son.
Having been thus addressed, Vaidehī unaffected by fear, although exercised with grief, placing a blade of grass between herself and Rāvana, answered him.
There was a king named Dasaratha, the bridge of righteousness, like to a mountain, ever bearing regard towards the truth, and renowned among men, whose son is Rāghava. He is named Rāma, and is righteous-souled and celebrated over the three worlds. he is long-armed, of expansive eyes, like to a celestial—he is my husband.
Born in the race of the Ikşvākus, the has the shoulders of a lion and is possessed of exceeding effulgence-the same that along with his brother, Laksmana, shall take your life. If you had wronged me forcibly in his presence, you would have slain in battle in Janasthāna even as Khara.
All the mighty Rākşasas of grim visages, whom you have extolled (before me), shall be deprived of their venom before Rāma, as serpents are before Suparna,
The shafts decorated with gold shot by the bow-string of Rāghava, shall pierce their bodies, as the waves of the Ganga (beat against) her banks.
Although, O Rāvana, you may be incapable of being slain either by the gods or the Asuras, yet having roused the high hostility of Rāghava, you will not be able to liberate your life.
The strong Rāghava will compass the end of what remains of your life. Like the life of a beast tied to the sacrificial stake, your own is incapable of being reclaimed.
Should Rāma look at you with eyes aglow with anger, you, O Raksasa, would be consumed even as Manmatha was by, Rudra.
He who is able to bring down the Moon or destroy him, and to drink up the ocean dry, will surely liberate Sītā from here.
Your days are numbered, and auspiciousness has bidden you adieu. You are shorn of strength, and your senses have been dulled. And it is owing to you that Larkā shall be subject to widowhood.
That you by force have for naught carried me away from the side of my husband-this sinful act can never conduce to your felicity.
That exceedingly effulgent lord of mine along with my husband's younger brother, summoning up their energy, is fearlessly dwelling in the vacant Dandaka.
By means of an arrowy shower in conflict, he will take your prowess and strength, your hauteur and wickedness out of your person,
When urged by the Destroyer, the destruction of creatures is perceptible, then, coming under the sway of the Destroyer, men become careless in their actions.
Having outraged me, you, O worst of Rāks asas your time come; for compassing your own destruction as well as that of the Rākşasas and those dwelling in your inner apartment.
A Candāla cannot tread the dais reared the midst of a sacrifice beauteous with ladies, and vessels, and sanctified by the twice-born ones.
So I, the religiously wedded wife of that one, ever intent on virtue, and (always) firm in my vows, is incapable, you vilest of Raksasas, of being touched by you, a sinner.
How can the female that has always ‘sported with her mate amidst lotuses, cast her eyes on a shag staying among rushes.
Do you either bind or destroy this body deprived of sensation. This body will I not protect, nor yet this life, O Rāvana;
And I shall not be able to bring blame on myself in this world. having said these harsh words in wrath, Videha's daughter, Janaki, did not there again say anything to Rāvaņa.
Hearing Sita's words, harsh and calculated to make one's down stand on end, Rāvana answered her in words tending to excite one's apprehension,
Hear, O Maithili, my words. O damsel if, O you of sweet smiles, within this time you do not turn yourself to me, the cooks shall cut you off in pieces to serve my morning mcal.
Having herself spoken thus, Ravana-challenger of foes-growing exceedingly wroth, addressed the Rākşasis in these words,
You frightful Rākşasīs terrible to behold, subsisting on flesh and gore, do you at once crush her pride.
As soon as he had said this, those frightful and terrible Rākṣasīs with joined hands encircled Maithili.
Then the grim-visaged king Ravana, as if riving the earth by his tread, proceeding a pace or two, said,
Do you take Maithilī to the wood of Asokas. There surrounding her, do you secretly guard her; and there (sometimes) by storming, and (at other) by means of soft speech, do you all strive to bring Mithila's daughter, like a wild female elephant, under your sway.
Thus commanded by Rāvana, those Rākşasis taking Maithili along with them, went to the Asoka wood, abounding with trees granting every desire, and filled with various kinds of fruits and flowers, and frequented by fowls fraught with juices at all seasons.
And as a doe comes under the subjection of tigresses, Janaka's daughter, Maithili, her frame worked up with grief, came under the sway of the Raksasis.
And like a female deer fast bound by a trap, Janaka's timid daughter Maithilī, agitated by the mighty grief, did not attain respite.
And greatly up-braided by the fierce eyes (of the Raksasis), Maithili did not know repose; and, afflicted with grief and fear, she, remembering her beloved lord along with Lakşmaņa swooned away.
Having been thus addressed, Vaidehi unaffected by fear, although exercised with grief, placing a blade of grass between herself and Ravana, answered him.
On Sītā having entered Lankā, the great father addressed the gratified Devendra of an hundred sacrifices, For bringing about the weal of the three worlds, and the woe of the Rākşasas, Sītā has been taken into Lankā by the wickedminded, Rāvaņa.
Devoted to her husband, the exalted lady always brought up in happiness, not seeing her husband, and seeing (on the other hand) environed by numbers of Räkşasīs,-is hungering after the sight of her lord.
The city of Lankā is situated on the shores of the lord of rivers and streams. How can Rāma get a knowledge of that blameless one, staying there?
Brooding over the various ills she has undergone, that exceedingly rare damsel is passing her days. Surely she will resign her existence. Great is the doubt that has arisen as to Sītā putting a period to her existence.
Having yourself from here, do you see the fair-faced Sītā. having entered the city of Lankā, Offer excellent clarified butter.
Thus addressed by the reverend chastiser of Pāka, Devendra in company with sleep, approached the city ruled by Rāvana.
He then addressed sleep, saying. Go you; and stupefy the Räksasas. Thus accosted by Maghavat, that goddess, exceedingly delighted, for securing success to the work of the celestials, covered the Rākşasas with stupor.
In the meanwhile, that god, the thousand-eyed lord of Śacī went to (Sītā) staying in the woods, and spoke to her these words,
I am the sovereign of the celestials. Good betide you! I am here, O you of luminous smiles! For securing success to the work of the magnanimous Rāghava, I will lend my aid to you. Do not, Odaughter of Janaka, grieve.
Through my grace, he shall along with his forces cross over the ocean. And, O excellent wench, I have by my supernal power, stupified the Raksasis.
And, O Sita, for this reason, I along with sleep, taking these rice, rice boiled in clarified butter, have, O Vaidehi, corne to you.
If you partake of these from my hand, you shall never O beauteous one, be afflicted either with hunger or thirst, O you of thighs resembling rambhā (trunks), for years.
Thus addressed, Sītā, alarmed, said, How can I know you for Devendra, Saci's husband, staying here?
By the side of Rāma and Lakşmaņa, I had beheld the signs of the celestials. If, O Devendra, you are yourself the sovereign of the celestials, show those to me.
Hearing Sītā's words, the lord of Saçī did accordingly. he did not touch the earth with his feet, and his eyes remained winkless. he bloomed in youth, and the blossoms did not fade on his attire. Thereupon knowing him for Vāsava, Sītā was overjoyed.
And weeping, she spoke regarding Rāghava, By luck it is that I had heard of that mightyarmed one along with his brother.
As is my father-in-law, the king, as is the master of Mithilā, so are you (to me), you whom I behold to-day; my husband has now found a protector.
And by your command, O Devendra, will I partake of this pāyasa cooked with milk, which has been offered to me, and which shall enhance (the prosperity) of our race.
Thereupon taking the pāyasa from Indra's hands, that Maithilī of luminous smiles (mentally) offered it to her husband as well as Laksmana.
If my mighty lord live along with his brother, let this through my reverence for them, be theirs. She then partook of the pāyasa herself.
Having thus eaten it, that one of excellent countenance, had her hunger and rising sorrow removed; and attaining a mental tendency from Indra, Janaki grew glad with reference to the Kakutsthas.
And Sakra also for bringing about the success of Rāghava's work, with a pleased mind, went to the abode of celestials. And greeting Sītā again and again, that high-souled celestial, in company with sleep went back to his own abode.
Seeing Śūrpanakhā speak harsh words in the midst of the courtiers, Ravana, being enraged, asked her.
Who is Rāma? And what is his prowess? And what his form? And what his power? And why had he entered the forest of Dandaka, difficult to range?
And what Rāma's weapons, by means of which he had slain the Rākşasas?. And Khara has been slain in battle, and Dūşaņa and Trisirā.
Do you, O you of a pleasing person, tell me the truth. And who had deformed you?
Thus addressed by the lord of the Rākṣasas, the Raksasi, transported with rage, commenced to duly narrate all about Rāma. Rāma the son of Dasaratha is long-armed, of expansive eyes, clad in bark and dark deer-skin, and like Kandarpa in grace.
And drawing a bow resembling that of Sakra, decked with golden rings, he discharges blazing nāracas, like to serpents of virulent poison.
I do not see in the field, Rāma drawing his bow: I only see the host being slaughtered by a shower of shafts. And as Indra destroys (a field of) goodly crops, by pouring down hail stones, fourteen thousand Räksasas of dreadful prowess, as well as Khara and Duşaņa were in a little over a moment slain with sharp shafts by Rāma alone fighting on foot. And he had reassured the saints, and after having been deformed, I alone from fear of slaying a woman, have been let off by the high-souled Rāma knowing self.
His brother is endued with mighty energy, and in merit, is of equal prowess, and he is devoted to his brother, and bear him regard; the puissant one is named Laksmana. And wrathful and invincible and victorious, and powerful, and intelligent and mighty, (he) is Rāma's right-arı-his life ranging externally.
And Rāma's virtuously wedded beloved wife having expansive eyes, and a face resembling the full-moon, is ever to the welfare of her lord.
And that fair-haired, fair-nosed, and fairthighed illustrious one possessed of beauty, grace the forest like a goddess, as if a goddess of wealth herself.
Of the lustre of burnished gold, with her finger nails reddish and projecting, and graceful, that surpassingly lovely wench is named Sītā—the slender-waisted daughter of Videha.
And neither a goddess, nor a Gandharvi, nor a Yaksi, nor a Kinnari, had I seen before on earth, possessed of such beauty.
He that shall have Sītā for his spouse, and who shall be warmly embraced by her, shall live longer in the world than the Lord of celestials himself.
That good-natured girl, unparalleled on earth in loveliness, who can well pride herself on her person, is a worthy wife for you, and you too are a fit husband for her.
It is to bring over for you that one of spacious hips, and a high and well-developed bust, that I had put forth my endeavours. But, O mightyarmed one I have been disfigured by the wicked Laksmana.
As soon as you have seen Vaidehi having a countenance resembling the full moon, you shall be afflicted with the shafts of Cupid.
If it is your purpose to have her for your wife, at once stretch forth your right leg. for attaining success.
If, O lord of Raksasas, you relish my speech, do you then, O Ravana, without fear, do as I tell you.
Understanding their incapacity, do you, O lord of Rākṣasas, for making her your wife, by force carry away the frail Sītā of a blameless person.
Hearing that Rāma by means of straight coursing shafts, has slain the Rākşasas that had gone to Janasthāna, and seeing Khara and Düşaņa, killed, do you ascertaining your course, adopt it.
Seeing the king had ascended heaven, like to a fire that has cooled, or an ocean deprived of its waters, or the sun shorn of his splendour, Kausalyā afflicted with woe, taking on her lap the head of the king, with tears in her eyes, said.
O Kaikeyī, attain you your wished: do you enjoy this kingdom rid of your thorn. O cruel one, O you of wicked ways, you that forsaking the king had set your heart (on having your son crowned), Rāma had gone away, forsaking me; and now my lord has ascended heaven. I can no longer bear to live, like one left lone in a wilderness by her companions.
What other woman except Kaikeyi lost to righteousness, having lost her deity, her lord, wishes to carry on existence in another's kingdom?
As a covetous person taking poison (through anger or some other passion), does not consider himself guilty, (so Kaikeyī) having done this evil through Manthara's incitement, does not bring her guilt home to her mind. It is through the instrumentality of the humpbacked woman that this race of the Rāghavas has been destroyed by Kaikeyi. Hearing that the king being made to do an unrighteous action, has banished Rāma together with his wife, king Janaka will be filled with grief as I have been.
That virtuous one does not know that to-day I have become helpless and been widowed. Răma of eyes resembling lotus-petals has living been removed from my sight.
The fair daughter of Videha's king unworthy of hardship, in ascetic guise is leading a life of trouble and terror in the woods.
Hearing at night the dreadful roars of birds and beasts crying, she exceedingly frightened takes shelter with Rāghava.
Old and having an only daughter, he revolving in his mind thoughts of Vaidehi, shall, smitten with grief, surely renounce his life. I ever faithful to my lord will die this very day, embracing this body; I will enter fire.
As embracing the (dead) body, that unfortunate lady was bewailing, the courtiers had the distressed (queen) removed from there.
Then placing the corpse of the king in a (capacious) pan with oil, the courtiers performed the mourning rites of the monarch.
But well versed in everything, the counsellors, in the absence of his son, did not perform the funeral obsequies of the king; and therefore they placed his body stretched in the pan of oil. Alas! at length concluding it for certain that the king was dead, the ladies burst out into lamentaions.
And raising their arms, with tears trickling down their faces, they in dire affliction and extremely exercised with grief, lamented.
O monarch, why do you forsake us, who have been already deprived of Rāma ever speaking fair and firm in promise?
Renounced by Rāma, how shall we, rendered widows, stay with the wicked Kaikeyi, co-wife with us?
That one of free soul is our master, as he is the lord of yourself. Rāma has gone to the woods, forsaking regal dignity.
Deprived of you as well as that hero, and overwhelmed with misfortune, how shall we live reprimanded by Kaikeyi?
She that has renounced the king, Rāma, and Lakşmaņa along with Sītā, whom can such a one not renounce?
Thus with tears in their eyes, the wives of that descendant of Raghu, joyless and convulsed with a huge passion, displayed signs of sorrow.
Like a night without stars, like a fair one forsaken by her husband, the city of Ayodhyā without the magnanimous monarch did not appear delightful as it had done before, with the populace filled with tears, the ladies uttering exclamations of distress, and the terraces and courts deserted.
On the lord of men having ascended heaven from grief, and the wives of the king remaining on the earth, the sun, his journey done, set, and the night began her course.
The idea of consuming the king's corpse in the absence of his son did not recommended itself to the assembled. adherents (of the departed). Thinking this, they in that way laid the king endowed with an inconceivably dignified presence.
And with her terraces overflowing with tears that flooded the throats of the mourners, the city appeared like the welkin without its splendour in the absence of the sun, or the night with the stars enveloped.
And on on the demise of that illustrious personage, in the city men and women in multitudes, censuring Bharata's mother, became extremely distressed, and did not attain peace of mind.
That lover of virtue, thinking of the miseries of the forest, resolved no to take Sītā with him, who was versed in religious lore's and had spoken thus.
And consoling her whose eyes were stained with tears, that virtuous-souled one spoke to her the following words with a view to prevent her from going.
Oh Sītā, you are born of an illustrious family and ever intent on the performance of religious deeds; do you practise virtue here as it may conduce to the happiness of my mind.
Oh Sītā, Oh you of the weaker sex, Do you act up to my counsels; there are evils enough in the forest, do you learn them from me who am about to dwell in it.
Renounce therefore, Oh Sītă, your intention of flying as an exile to the forest, which for its impenetrableness is said to abound in evils.
It is for your welfare that I give utterance to these words; happiness there is none, it is always covered with miseries.
The roarings of the lions living in the caves of mountains, swelling with the sounds of the water-falls, produce a very painful impression upon the ears; so the wood is full of misery.
Animals, all maddened, sporting in solitude, seeing (man), approach to attack him; so the wood is full of misery.
The rivers are full of crocodiles, sharks, and other fearful animals, muddy and impassable and always infested with infuriated elephants; so the wood is full of misery.
There the wayfarers are covered with creepers and thorns they are void of drinking water ever resounded with the noise of the wild fowls, so the wood is full of misery.
Being exhausted with the toil of the day, the dwellers of the wood have to sleep in night on the bed made of leaves fallen from the trees on the surface of the ground; so the wood is full of misery.
With the (supply of) fruits that have fallen from the trees man of self discipline must content himself morning and evening; so the wood, O Sītă, is full of misery.
One has to fast, O Maithili, according to his might, to wear matted hair and bark, to adore the deities and his ancestors according to due rites, every day to serve the guests that come to him, and observing the rules of asceticism, to bathe every day thrice, namely, in the morning, in the mid-day and in the evening; so the wood is full of misery.
One has to offer presents of flowers collected by his ownself to the altars, O Sītā, according to the rites of the ascetics; so the wood is full of misery.
Those that dwell in the forest will have to remain content, having practised moderation in food, O Maithill, with whatever edibles are attainable in the forest; so the wood is full of misery.
There are always violent winds, darkness hunger, and great fear; so the wood is full of misery.
Reptiles, many and of various kinds, creep there on the path, O excellent lady, with haughtiness; so the wood is full of misery.
And snakes living in the rivers and of crooked course like them, always await the wayfarers, hindering the passers-by: so the wood is full of misery.
Birds, scorpions, insects mosquito's and wild gnats, always disturb the dwellers, O fair one' of the weaker sex; so the wood is full misery.
There are trees full of thorns, having their branches moving to and fro, and the kusa and kāsa grasses with thorny blades constantly undulating; so the wood is full misery.
There are various physical afflictions and divers fears and great misery consequent upon living in the forest. Anger and desires are to be renounced, the heart is to be set on ascetic austerities, fear in the fearful objects is to be cast off; so the wood is full of misery.
You should not therefore go to the forest, it forebodes no good to you. Weighing well, have I concluded that the forest abounds in innumerable evils.
While the high-souled Rāma, resolved thus not to take Sītā with him to the forest, she, greatly sorry, did not accept his words and spoke to him in the following way.
Beholding Sumali slain and reduced to ashes by Vasu and being assailed by the deities the Räksasa host fled into diverse directions. And collecting all the Rākşasas stood there the highly powerful Meghanāda, enraged, the son of Ravana.
Like to flaming fire approaching towards forest that great car-warrior encountered the enemies in a precious car coursing at will.
As soon as he, armed with various weapons, entered the field the celestials, at his very sight. And away to all directions.
None could stand before him, well-versed in war-fare. Thereupon beholding the deities terrified and pierced with shafts, Indra, the king of gods, said.
Be not afraid, O you celestials; do not fly away; come back to the battle; this my son, who has never been vanquished, goes to battle.
Thereupon Sakra's son, known as divine Jayanta, proceeded towards the field of action by a wondrous car.
Having encircled Saci's son and encountered Rāvana's son, the deities began to assail him.
The encounter between Mahendra's son Jayanta and Rāvana's son Meghanāda was like one between gods and demons.
Thereupon Rāvana's son began to assail, with shafts feathered in gold, his (Jayanta's) charioteer Gomukha, Mātali's son.
Sacīs son too, enraged, assailed on all sides, Rāvana's son and his charioteer. And the powerful Rāvani, stricken with ire and with eyes expanded, covered Sakra's son with arrows.
Thereupon Rāvana's son struck the celestial host with thousands of huge mountain summits, Śataghnīs, maces, Prāsas, Prāsas, clubs, daggers, Paraśus and various other sharp pointed weapons.
Rāvana's son thus striking Indra's army the quarters were enshrouded with darkness by his illusory power.
Being overpowered with arrows on all sides the celestial army, leaving aside Jayanta, became restless.
The deities or the Rākşasas, they could not recognise one another. And being distressed they ran about on all sides.
