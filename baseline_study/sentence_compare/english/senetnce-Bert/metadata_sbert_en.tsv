When Şītā, having a husband although seeming as if she had none, was putting on the ascetic guise, the people got into a wrath and exclaimed, “O Dasaratha, fie on you!"
Aggrieved at the uproar that arose there in consequence, the lord of earth banished from his heart all regard for life, virtue, and fame. And sighing hot, that descendant of Ikşvāku spoke to that wife of his, saying, O Kaikeyi, Sītā deserves not to go in a Kuća dress.
Tender, and youthful, and worthy of happiness, she is by no means capable of living in the forest. My spiritual guide has spoken the truth.
Whom has this one injured that, being the daughter of the foremost of kings, she like a female ascetic, wearing a meagre garb in the presence of all, will (repair to the woods and) remain there like a beggar destitute of everything?
Let Janaka's daughter leave off her ascetic guise. This is not the promise that I had made to you before. Let the princess go to the forest in comfort, furnished with all sorts of gems.
My sands run out; by me has this cruel promise been made with an oath. But this (exile of Sītä) has been thought of by you through your ignorance. Let it not, however, consume you like a bamboo flower destroying the bamboo.
If, O wicked woman, Rāma has happened to do you something unbeautiful, what wrong, O base wretch, has Vaidehi done you in the world?
Of eyes expanded like those of a doe, endued with a mild temperament, and virtuous, what harm has Janaka's daughter done you.
Surely, O nefarious one, the banishment of Ráma is enough for you. Why then do you bend your mind to perpetrate these atrocious sins?
O noble dame, having heard you asking for the banishment of Rāma, who had at first been intended by me for being installed, and who came here afterwards, I had promised you (his exile alone.)
But since, going beyond that promise of mine, you behold Mithala's daughter dressed in mendicant garb, surely you wish to find your way to hell.
Thus commissioned to the forest, Räma who was seated sealing his lips, said.
O righteous one, this my mother is aged and famous and of lofty spirit. May she not meet with improper treatment at your hands! It behoves you, O bestower of boons, to show greater honour to her when she shall be deprived of me and be plunged into a sea of grief and afflicted with unprecedented woe.
O you comparable to the mighty Indra, you should so behove with my mother smitten with my separation, that exercised by grief in consequence of my residence in the forest, she may not, renouncing life, repair to the mansions of Yama.
Hearing those bold words of the ascetic, the son of that foremost of men, Rāghava firm in his vows, with clasped hands answered.
In accordance with the desire of my sire, and in order to glorify it, I ought fearlessly to do even as Kusika's son says. And having been desired to that end while at Ayodhyā by that high-souled one, my father Dasaratha, in the midst of the spiritual guides, I ought not to pass by your words.
Therefore, commanded by that upholder of the Veda, I, agreeably to my father's mandate, will, without doubt, bring about that welcome event-the death of Tataka.
And in the interests of Brāhmaṇas, kine, and celestials, I am ready to act as desired by you of immeasurable energy.
Having said this, that repressor of foes, with clenched fist, twanged his bow-string, filling the ten cardinal points with the sounds. And at those sounds, the dwellers in Tāțakā's forest were filled with perturbation, and Tātakā also amazed at those sounds, became exceedingly wroth.
And rendered almost insensible by anger, that Räksasī furiously rushed in a main towards the spot whence had come the report.
And beholding that frightful one of hideous visage and colossal proportions, transported with rage, Raghu's descendant spoke to Laksmana,9
Behold, O Laksmana, the terrible and hideous body of yonder Yakṣiṇī! The sight of her strike terror into the hearts of even the brave.
Mark! This irrepressible one, possessing all the resources of illusion, will I oppose, and deprive her of ears and nose.
But I dare not slay her, she being protected by virtue of her feminineness. I intend only to oppose her course, and deprive her of her prowess.
As Rāma was speaking thus, Tāțakā, deprived of sense through ire, uttering roars, with uplifted arms rushed against him.
And thereat the Brahmarsi, Visvāmitra, uttering a roar, upbraided her, and said, Svasti!* May victory attend the descendants of Raghu! *A particle of benediction, indeclinable.
And raising thick clouds of dust, Tāțakā instantly bewildered both the descendants of Raghu.
And then by help of illusion, she began to pour upon them a mighty shower of crags. And thereat Raghu's descendant was wroth.
And resisting that mighty shower of crags by vollies of shafts, Rāghava with arrows cut off her hands.
And with the fore-parts of her arms lopped off, as she was roaring before them, Sumitra's son waxing wroth deprived her of her ears and nose.
Thereupon that one capable of assuming forms at will, began to assume various shapes; and to vanish from sight, bewildering her antagonists with her illusory displays.
Terribly ranging the field, the Yakṣī showered crags upon her antagonists. And beholding them enveloped on all sides by that craggy downpour, the auspicious son of Gadhi spoke these words-O Rāma, renounce your antipathy. This one of wicked ways is exceedingly impious. And this sacrifice-disturbing Yakși will, by virtue of her power of illusion, come to increase more and more in energy. Do you, therefore, against the arrival of dusk, slay her! The Rākṣasas are incapable of being controlled when evening sets in.
Thus addressed, Rāma, displaying his skill in aiming by sounds, enveloped with arrows that Yakṣī showering crags.
Being thus hemmed in with a network of shafts, she possessed of the powers of illusion, rushed against Kākutstha and Lakşmaņa, uttering terrible roars. And as that Yaksi, in prowess like to a thunder-bolt, was rushing on, Rāma pierced her chest with arrows, and thereat she dropped down and died.
Upon seeing that grim-visaged one slain, the lord of the celestials together with the celestials themselves honouring Kākutstha, exclaimed Well, Well!.
And exceedingly pleased, the thousand-eyed Purandara, together with the delighted deities, said to Viśvāmitra.
O ascetic, O Kusika's son, good betide you! all the Maruts with Indra at their head, have been gratified with this act (of Rāma's). Do you, O Brāhmaṇa, confer upon Raghu's descendant the sons of Prajāpati Kțśāśva, of true prowess, and charged with ascetic energy.
And ever following you, he, O Brāhmaṇa, is fit to receive them of you. And this son of the king is to accomplish a mighty task in the interests of the celestials.
Saying this, the deities, having paid homage to Viśvāmitra, joyfully entered the celestial regions.
And now came evening on, when that best of ascetics, gratified at the destruction of Tāțakā, smelt Rāma's crown and said these words,
Here, O Rāma of gracious presence, shall we pass the night; and morrow morning, went to that hermitage of mine.
Hearing Visvāmitra's words, Dasaratha's son, glad at heart, happily passed that night in the forest of Tāțakā.
And being thus freed from all disturbances, from that day forth that forest appeared charming, even like to the forest of Caitraratha.
Having thus slain the Yakşa's daughter, Rāma, eulogised by celestials and Siddhas, spent there that night with the saint, being awakened by the latter at the break of day.
Thereupon the high-souled Rāma, along with Sugrīva, proceeded from the mount Rșyamuka to Kiskindha, maintained by Vali's prowess, raising up his gold crested mighty bow and taking his battle arrows like to Aditya.
The mighty Sugrīva, bending low, proceeded before the high-souled Rama and Laksmana.
They were followed by the heroic Hanumān, the mighty Nala and Neela, and the highly powerful Tārā, the leader of the monkey herd.
They beheld as they proceeded, trees, lowered down with the weight of flowers, rivers of clear water flowing to the ocean, mountain hollows, hills, caves, cavities, and principal peaks and charming rills.
They. beheld on their way, pools filled with water clear as Baidurya and beautified with lotuses-full blown and buds, and resounded with the cries of Kārandhabas, swans, geese, Banculas, water-fowls, Cakravākas, and various other birds.
They surveyed all around in the forest-land, deer ranging fearlessly at large and grazing on tender grass.
They beheld frightful wild elephants having white teeth, ranging alone-the destroyers of river banks and enemies of pools. And observing many an infuriated monkey like to elephants, resembling so many moveable mountains riving the mountainous expanses crusted with dust, and many other wild beasts and birds the followers of Sugrīva wended their way.
They proceeding quickly, Rama, the descendant of Raghu, beholding the forest filled with trees, spoke to Sugrīva, saying.
These trees skirted by plantain groves, dense as a collection of clouds, appear as clouds in the sky. Great is my curiosity, O friend, to learn what are these. 'And I wish to have my curiosity removed by you.
Hearing the words of the high-souled Rāghava, Sugrīva began to describe that great forest.
In this extensive asylum, O Rāghava, removing the toil (of the travellers) filled with gardens and trees and abounding in delicious fruits, roots and water, dwelt seven Saints, having control over their senses. Those seven Saints, dwelling on the mountain, passed days and nights in water with their heads down and after seven nights used to live upon air. In this wise, passing seven hundred years they repaired bodily to heaven.
By virtue of their asceticism, this asylum is walled by trees and incapable of being conquered even by Indra, the celestials and the Asuras.
Birds or other wild animals do not enter this asylum; whoever entereth this by mistake never returneth.
There is audible, O Rāghava, the sound of the dressing of Apsarās, their sweet-winged accents and that of their music and drums; and herçin pervadeth the celestial fragrance.
Here burneth the fire Tretā; and the smoke and cloud sable like to the wings of a pigeon envelope the tops of the trees.
And there appear the trees, having their tops saturated with smoke and cloaked with clouds, like to so many Baidurya hills.
Do you, O Rāghava, O virtuous-souled one, make obeisance to them along with your brother Lakṣmaṇa, with concentrated heart and folded palms.
There resteth no sin in their persons, O Rāma, who bow to those self-controlled Saints.
Thereupon Rāma, along with his younger brother Lakşmaņa, made obeisance to those high-souled ones.
Having paid homage (to the sacred memory of those great ones) the virtuous-souled Rāma his (younger) brother Laksmana, Sugriva and other monkeys, proceeded with delighted hearts.
And wending a distant way from that hermitage of the seven great ones, they beheld Kişkindhä, hard to conquer and occupied by Vali.
Thereupon, Rāma, his younger brother and the monkeys taking their weapons, entered, to encompass the destruction of their enemies, the city (of Kişkindhā) reared by the prowess of Indra's son.
Having been thus addressed, Vaidehī unaffected by fear, although exercised with grief, placing a blade of grass between herself and Rāvana, answered him.
There was a king named Dasaratha, the bridge of righteousness, like to a mountain, ever bearing regard towards the truth, and renowned among men, whose son is Rāghava. He is named Rāma, and is righteous-souled and celebrated over the three worlds. he is long-armed, of expansive eyes, like to a celestial—he is my husband.
Born in the race of the Ikşvākus, the has the shoulders of a lion and is possessed of exceeding effulgence-the same that along with his brother, Laksmana, shall take your life. If you had wronged me forcibly in his presence, you would have slain in battle in Janasthāna even as Khara.
All the mighty Rākşasas of grim visages, whom you have extolled (before me), shall be deprived of their venom before Rāma, as serpents are before Suparna,
The shafts decorated with gold shot by the bow-string of Rāghava, shall pierce their bodies, as the waves of the Ganga (beat against) her banks.
Although, O Rāvana, you may be incapable of being slain either by the gods or the Asuras, yet having roused the high hostility of Rāghava, you will not be able to liberate your life.
The strong Rāghava will compass the end of what remains of your life. Like the life of a beast tied to the sacrificial stake, your own is incapable of being reclaimed.
Should Rāma look at you with eyes aglow with anger, you, O Raksasa, would be consumed even as Manmatha was by, Rudra.
He who is able to bring down the Moon or destroy him, and to drink up the ocean dry, will surely liberate Sītā from here.
Your days are numbered, and auspiciousness has bidden you adieu. You are shorn of strength, and your senses have been dulled. And it is owing to you that Larkā shall be subject to widowhood.
That you by force have for naught carried me away from the side of my husband-this sinful act can never conduce to your felicity.
That exceedingly effulgent lord of mine along with my husband's younger brother, summoning up their energy, is fearlessly dwelling in the vacant Dandaka.
By means of an arrowy shower in conflict, he will take your prowess and strength, your hauteur and wickedness out of your person,
When urged by the Destroyer, the destruction of creatures is perceptible, then, coming under the sway of the Destroyer, men become careless in their actions.
Having outraged me, you, O worst of Rāks asas your time come; for compassing your own destruction as well as that of the Rākşasas and those dwelling in your inner apartment.
A Candāla cannot tread the dais reared the midst of a sacrifice beauteous with ladies, and vessels, and sanctified by the twice-born ones.
So I, the religiously wedded wife of that one, ever intent on virtue, and (always) firm in my vows, is incapable, you vilest of Raksasas, of being touched by you, a sinner.
How can the female that has always ‘sported with her mate amidst lotuses, cast her eyes on a shag staying among rushes.
Do you either bind or destroy this body deprived of sensation. This body will I not protect, nor yet this life, O Rāvana;
And I shall not be able to bring blame on myself in this world. having said these harsh words in wrath, Videha's daughter, Janaki, did not there again say anything to Rāvaņa.
Hearing Sita's words, harsh and calculated to make one's down stand on end, Rāvana answered her in words tending to excite one's apprehension,
Hear, O Maithili, my words. O damsel if, O you of sweet smiles, within this time you do not turn yourself to me, the cooks shall cut you off in pieces to serve my morning mcal.
Having herself spoken thus, Ravana-challenger of foes-growing exceedingly wroth, addressed the Rākşasis in these words,
You frightful Rākşasīs terrible to behold, subsisting on flesh and gore, do you at once crush her pride.
As soon as he had said this, those frightful and terrible Rākṣasīs with joined hands encircled Maithili.
Then the grim-visaged king Ravana, as if riving the earth by his tread, proceeding a pace or two, said,
Do you take Maithilī to the wood of Asokas. There surrounding her, do you secretly guard her; and there (sometimes) by storming, and (at other) by means of soft speech, do you all strive to bring Mithila's daughter, like a wild female elephant, under your sway.
Thus commanded by Rāvana, those Rākşasis taking Maithili along with them, went to the Asoka wood, abounding with trees granting every desire, and filled with various kinds of fruits and flowers, and frequented by fowls fraught with juices at all seasons.
And as a doe comes under the subjection of tigresses, Janaka's daughter, Maithili, her frame worked up with grief, came under the sway of the Raksasis.
And like a female deer fast bound by a trap, Janaka's timid daughter Maithilī, agitated by the mighty grief, did not attain respite.
And greatly up-braided by the fierce eyes (of the Raksasis), Maithili did not know repose; and, afflicted with grief and fear, she, remembering her beloved lord along with Lakşmaņa swooned away.
Having been thus addressed, Vaidehi unaffected by fear, although exercised with grief, placing a blade of grass between herself and Ravana, answered him.
On Sītā having entered Lankā, the great father addressed the gratified Devendra of an hundred sacrifices, For bringing about the weal of the three worlds, and the woe of the Rākşasas, Sītā has been taken into Lankā by the wickedminded, Rāvaņa.
Devoted to her husband, the exalted lady always brought up in happiness, not seeing her husband, and seeing (on the other hand) environed by numbers of Räkşasīs,-is hungering after the sight of her lord.
The city of Lankā is situated on the shores of the lord of rivers and streams. How can Rāma get a knowledge of that blameless one, staying there?
Brooding over the various ills she has undergone, that exceedingly rare damsel is passing her days. Surely she will resign her existence. Great is the doubt that has arisen as to Sītā putting a period to her existence.
Having yourself from here, do you see the fair-faced Sītā. having entered the city of Lankā, Offer excellent clarified butter.
Thus addressed by the reverend chastiser of Pāka, Devendra in company with sleep, approached the city ruled by Rāvana.
He then addressed sleep, saying. Go you; and stupefy the Räksasas. Thus accosted by Maghavat, that goddess, exceedingly delighted, for securing success to the work of the celestials, covered the Rākşasas with stupor.
In the meanwhile, that god, the thousand-eyed lord of Śacī went to (Sītā) staying in the woods, and spoke to her these words,
I am the sovereign of the celestials. Good betide you! I am here, O you of luminous smiles! For securing success to the work of the magnanimous Rāghava, I will lend my aid to you. Do not, Odaughter of Janaka, grieve.
Through my grace, he shall along with his forces cross over the ocean. And, O excellent wench, I have by my supernal power, stupified the Raksasis.
And, O Sita, for this reason, I along with sleep, taking these rice, rice boiled in clarified butter, have, O Vaidehi, corne to you.
If you partake of these from my hand, you shall never O beauteous one, be afflicted either with hunger or thirst, O you of thighs resembling rambhā (trunks), for years.
Thus addressed, Sītā, alarmed, said, How can I know you for Devendra, Saci's husband, staying here?
By the side of Rāma and Lakşmaņa, I had beheld the signs of the celestials. If, O Devendra, you are yourself the sovereign of the celestials, show those to me.
Hearing Sītā's words, the lord of Saçī did accordingly. he did not touch the earth with his feet, and his eyes remained winkless. he bloomed in youth, and the blossoms did not fade on his attire. Thereupon knowing him for Vāsava, Sītā was overjoyed.
And weeping, she spoke regarding Rāghava, By luck it is that I had heard of that mightyarmed one along with his brother.
As is my father-in-law, the king, as is the master of Mithilā, so are you (to me), you whom I behold to-day; my husband has now found a protector.
And by your command, O Devendra, will I partake of this pāyasa cooked with milk, which has been offered to me, and which shall enhance (the prosperity) of our race.
Thereupon taking the pāyasa from Indra's hands, that Maithilī of luminous smiles (mentally) offered it to her husband as well as Laksmana.
If my mighty lord live along with his brother, let this through my reverence for them, be theirs. She then partook of the pāyasa herself.
Having thus eaten it, that one of excellent countenance, had her hunger and rising sorrow removed; and attaining a mental tendency from Indra, Janaki grew glad with reference to the Kakutsthas.
And Sakra also for bringing about the success of Rāghava's work, with a pleased mind, went to the abode of celestials. And greeting Sītā again and again, that high-souled celestial, in company with sleep went back to his own abode.
Seeing Śūrpanakhā speak harsh words in the midst of the courtiers, Ravana, being enraged, asked her.
Who is Rāma? And what is his prowess? And what his form? And what his power? And why had he entered the forest of Dandaka, difficult to range?
And what Rāma's weapons, by means of which he had slain the Rākşasas?. And Khara has been slain in battle, and Dūşaņa and Trisirā.
Do you, O you of a pleasing person, tell me the truth. And who had deformed you?
Thus addressed by the lord of the Rākṣasas, the Raksasi, transported with rage, commenced to duly narrate all about Rāma. Rāma the son of Dasaratha is long-armed, of expansive eyes, clad in bark and dark deer-skin, and like Kandarpa in grace.
And drawing a bow resembling that of Sakra, decked with golden rings, he discharges blazing nāracas, like to serpents of virulent poison.
I do not see in the field, Rāma drawing his bow: I only see the host being slaughtered by a shower of shafts. And as Indra destroys (a field of) goodly crops, by pouring down hail stones, fourteen thousand Räksasas of dreadful prowess, as well as Khara and Duşaņa were in a little over a moment slain with sharp shafts by Rāma alone fighting on foot. And he had reassured the saints, and after having been deformed, I alone from fear of slaying a woman, have been let off by the high-souled Rāma knowing self.
His brother is endued with mighty energy, and in merit, is of equal prowess, and he is devoted to his brother, and bear him regard; the puissant one is named Laksmana. And wrathful and invincible and victorious, and powerful, and intelligent and mighty, (he) is Rāma's right-arı-his life ranging externally.
And Rāma's virtuously wedded beloved wife having expansive eyes, and a face resembling the full-moon, is ever to the welfare of her lord.
And that fair-haired, fair-nosed, and fairthighed illustrious one possessed of beauty, grace the forest like a goddess, as if a goddess of wealth herself.
Of the lustre of burnished gold, with her finger nails reddish and projecting, and graceful, that surpassingly lovely wench is named Sītā—the slender-waisted daughter of Videha.
And neither a goddess, nor a Gandharvi, nor a Yaksi, nor a Kinnari, had I seen before on earth, possessed of such beauty.
He that shall have Sītā for his spouse, and who shall be warmly embraced by her, shall live longer in the world than the Lord of celestials himself.
That good-natured girl, unparalleled on earth in loveliness, who can well pride herself on her person, is a worthy wife for you, and you too are a fit husband for her.
It is to bring over for you that one of spacious hips, and a high and well-developed bust, that I had put forth my endeavours. But, O mightyarmed one I have been disfigured by the wicked Laksmana.
As soon as you have seen Vaidehi having a countenance resembling the full moon, you shall be afflicted with the shafts of Cupid.
If it is your purpose to have her for your wife, at once stretch forth your right leg. for attaining success.
If, O lord of Raksasas, you relish my speech, do you then, O Ravana, without fear, do as I tell you.
Understanding their incapacity, do you, O lord of Rākṣasas, for making her your wife, by force carry away the frail Sītā of a blameless person.
Hearing that Rāma by means of straight coursing shafts, has slain the Rākşasas that had gone to Janasthāna, and seeing Khara and Düşaņa, killed, do you ascertaining your course, adopt it.
Seeing the king had ascended heaven, like to a fire that has cooled, or an ocean deprived of its waters, or the sun shorn of his splendour, Kausalyā afflicted with woe, taking on her lap the head of the king, with tears in her eyes, said.
O Kaikeyī, attain you your wished: do you enjoy this kingdom rid of your thorn. O cruel one, O you of wicked ways, you that forsaking the king had set your heart (on having your son crowned), Rāma had gone away, forsaking me; and now my lord has ascended heaven. I can no longer bear to live, like one left lone in a wilderness by her companions.
What other woman except Kaikeyi lost to righteousness, having lost her deity, her lord, wishes to carry on existence in another's kingdom?
As a covetous person taking poison (through anger or some other passion), does not consider himself guilty, (so Kaikeyī) having done this evil through Manthara's incitement, does not bring her guilt home to her mind. It is through the instrumentality of the humpbacked woman that this race of the Rāghavas has been destroyed by Kaikeyi. Hearing that the king being made to do an unrighteous action, has banished Rāma together with his wife, king Janaka will be filled with grief as I have been.
That virtuous one does not know that to-day I have become helpless and been widowed. Răma of eyes resembling lotus-petals has living been removed from my sight.
The fair daughter of Videha's king unworthy of hardship, in ascetic guise is leading a life of trouble and terror in the woods.
Hearing at night the dreadful roars of birds and beasts crying, she exceedingly frightened takes shelter with Rāghava.
Old and having an only daughter, he revolving in his mind thoughts of Vaidehi, shall, smitten with grief, surely renounce his life. I ever faithful to my lord will die this very day, embracing this body; I will enter fire.
As embracing the (dead) body, that unfortunate lady was bewailing, the courtiers had the distressed (queen) removed from there.
Then placing the corpse of the king in a (capacious) pan with oil, the courtiers performed the mourning rites of the monarch.
But well versed in everything, the counsellors, in the absence of his son, did not perform the funeral obsequies of the king; and therefore they placed his body stretched in the pan of oil. Alas! at length concluding it for certain that the king was dead, the ladies burst out into lamentaions.
And raising their arms, with tears trickling down their faces, they in dire affliction and extremely exercised with grief, lamented.
O monarch, why do you forsake us, who have been already deprived of Rāma ever speaking fair and firm in promise?
Renounced by Rāma, how shall we, rendered widows, stay with the wicked Kaikeyi, co-wife with us?
That one of free soul is our master, as he is the lord of yourself. Rāma has gone to the woods, forsaking regal dignity.
Deprived of you as well as that hero, and overwhelmed with misfortune, how shall we live reprimanded by Kaikeyi?
She that has renounced the king, Rāma, and Lakşmaņa along with Sītā, whom can such a one not renounce?
Thus with tears in their eyes, the wives of that descendant of Raghu, joyless and convulsed with a huge passion, displayed signs of sorrow.
Like a night without stars, like a fair one forsaken by her husband, the city of Ayodhyā without the magnanimous monarch did not appear delightful as it had done before, with the populace filled with tears, the ladies uttering exclamations of distress, and the terraces and courts deserted.
On the lord of men having ascended heaven from grief, and the wives of the king remaining on the earth, the sun, his journey done, set, and the night began her course.
The idea of consuming the king's corpse in the absence of his son did not recommended itself to the assembled. adherents (of the departed). Thinking this, they in that way laid the king endowed with an inconceivably dignified presence.
And with her terraces overflowing with tears that flooded the throats of the mourners, the city appeared like the welkin without its splendour in the absence of the sun, or the night with the stars enveloped.
And on on the demise of that illustrious personage, in the city men and women in multitudes, censuring Bharata's mother, became extremely distressed, and did not attain peace of mind.
That lover of virtue, thinking of the miseries of the forest, resolved no to take Sītā with him, who was versed in religious lore's and had spoken thus.
And consoling her whose eyes were stained with tears, that virtuous-souled one spoke to her the following words with a view to prevent her from going.
Oh Sītā, you are born of an illustrious family and ever intent on the performance of religious deeds; do you practise virtue here as it may conduce to the happiness of my mind.
Oh Sītā, Oh you of the weaker sex, Do you act up to my counsels; there are evils enough in the forest, do you learn them from me who am about to dwell in it.
Renounce therefore, Oh Sītă, your intention of flying as an exile to the forest, which for its impenetrableness is said to abound in evils.
It is for your welfare that I give utterance to these words; happiness there is none, it is always covered with miseries.
The roarings of the lions living in the caves of mountains, swelling with the sounds of the water-falls, produce a very painful impression upon the ears; so the wood is full of misery.
Animals, all maddened, sporting in solitude, seeing (man), approach to attack him; so the wood is full of misery.
The rivers are full of crocodiles, sharks, and other fearful animals, muddy and impassable and always infested with infuriated elephants; so the wood is full of misery.
There the wayfarers are covered with creepers and thorns they are void of drinking water ever resounded with the noise of the wild fowls, so the wood is full of misery.
Being exhausted with the toil of the day, the dwellers of the wood have to sleep in night on the bed made of leaves fallen from the trees on the surface of the ground; so the wood is full of misery.
With the (supply of) fruits that have fallen from the trees man of self discipline must content himself morning and evening; so the wood, O Sītă, is full of misery.
One has to fast, O Maithili, according to his might, to wear matted hair and bark, to adore the deities and his ancestors according to due rites, every day to serve the guests that come to him, and observing the rules of asceticism, to bathe every day thrice, namely, in the morning, in the mid-day and in the evening; so the wood is full of misery.
One has to offer presents of flowers collected by his ownself to the altars, O Sītā, according to the rites of the ascetics; so the wood is full of misery.
Those that dwell in the forest will have to remain content, having practised moderation in food, O Maithill, with whatever edibles are attainable in the forest; so the wood is full of misery.
There are always violent winds, darkness hunger, and great fear; so the wood is full of misery.
Reptiles, many and of various kinds, creep there on the path, O excellent lady, with haughtiness; so the wood is full of misery.
And snakes living in the rivers and of crooked course like them, always await the wayfarers, hindering the passers-by: so the wood is full of misery.
Birds, scorpions, insects mosquito's and wild gnats, always disturb the dwellers, O fair one' of the weaker sex; so the wood is full misery.
There are trees full of thorns, having their branches moving to and fro, and the kusa and kāsa grasses with thorny blades constantly undulating; so the wood is full misery.
There are various physical afflictions and divers fears and great misery consequent upon living in the forest. Anger and desires are to be renounced, the heart is to be set on ascetic austerities, fear in the fearful objects is to be cast off; so the wood is full of misery.
You should not therefore go to the forest, it forebodes no good to you. Weighing well, have I concluded that the forest abounds in innumerable evils.
While the high-souled Rāma, resolved thus not to take Sītā with him to the forest, she, greatly sorry, did not accept his words and spoke to him in the following way.
Beholding Sumali slain and reduced to ashes by Vasu and being assailed by the deities the Räksasa host fled into diverse directions. And collecting all the Rākşasas stood there the highly powerful Meghanāda, enraged, the son of Ravana.
Like to flaming fire approaching towards forest that great car-warrior encountered the enemies in a precious car coursing at will.
As soon as he, armed with various weapons, entered the field the celestials, at his very sight. And away to all directions.
None could stand before him, well-versed in war-fare. Thereupon beholding the deities terrified and pierced with shafts, Indra, the king of gods, said.
Be not afraid, O you celestials; do not fly away; come back to the battle; this my son, who has never been vanquished, goes to battle.
Thereupon Sakra's son, known as divine Jayanta, proceeded towards the field of action by a wondrous car.
Having encircled Saci's son and encountered Rāvana's son, the deities began to assail him.
The encounter between Mahendra's son Jayanta and Rāvana's son Meghanāda was like one between gods and demons.
Thereupon Rāvana's son began to assail, with shafts feathered in gold, his (Jayanta's) charioteer Gomukha, Mātali's son.
Sacīs son too, enraged, assailed on all sides, Rāvana's son and his charioteer. And the powerful Rāvani, stricken with ire and with eyes expanded, covered Sakra's son with arrows.
Thereupon Rāvana's son struck the celestial host with thousands of huge mountain summits, Śataghnīs, maces, Prāsas, Prāsas, clubs, daggers, Paraśus and various other sharp pointed weapons.
Rāvana's son thus striking Indra's army the quarters were enshrouded with darkness by his illusory power.
Being overpowered with arrows on all sides the celestial army, leaving aside Jayanta, became restless.
The deities or the Rākşasas, they could not recognise one another. And being distressed they ran about on all sides.
Being enveloped with darkness and having their senses bewildered the celestials killed their own kith and the Rākṣasas their own men, and others fled away.
In the interim a heroic and powerful Daityachief, Pulomā, be name, taking ſacī's son disappeared.
Taking his own grand-son he entered into the ocean, Puloma was his grand-father for by him Śaci was begotten.
Thinking that Jayanta was slain all the deities greatly sorry and distressed fled away on all sides.
Thereupon Rāvana's son, enraged and encircled by his own powerful followers, pursued the celestials emitting loud cries.
Not beholding his son and observing the flight of the deities the king of the celestials said to Mātali, “Bring the car."
By Mātali was brought, the celestial, highly dreadful, huge and quick-coursing chariot, that was ready.
(And he having) ascended the car, the huge clouds, with lightening, being driven by winds, began to emit forth loud mutterings before the chariot.
The Gandharvas began to play on various instruments and the Apsarās began to dance.
Taking up various weapons, Indra, the king of divinities, set out for the field of action, in the company of Rudras, Vasus, Adityas, the two Asvins and Maruts.
He, having set out for battle, the winds began to blow high, the sun was divested of its brilliance and the huge fire-brands began to send out flames.
In the interval the heroic and the highly powerful Daśagrīva ascended the celestial car, constructed by the Architect of the deities, encircled by the huge-bodied serpents capable of making down erect and by whose breath the battle-field was ablaze.
Surrounded by demons and night-rangers and with the celestial car he encountered Mahendra in the battle-field.
Having desisted his son he himself stood there. And having coming out from the field of action Ravana's son too stood silent.
Thereupon there arose an encounter between the Räkşasas and the deities and there began a downpour of weapons in the conflict like clouds.
The vicious-souled Kumbhakarņa armed with various weapons came you, but he did not know,* O king, with whom the conflict was going on. *For he was asleep till then so he was not acquainted with the particulars war-fare. He used to sleep for six months at a time.
And by him enraged, the celestials were assailed with his teeth, feet, arms, hands, Saktis, Tomaras and clubs or any weapon whatsoever.
Thereupon the night-ranger engaged with the highly powerful Rudra and was wounded, in the conflict, with incessant strokes of weapons.
Thereupon the Rākşasas army began to fight with Maruts and they were overwhelmed in the encounter with the stroke of various weapons.
Some fell down on earth of their carriers in the battle. And they all stood there in a halfsensible mood, some holding the car, some elephants, some asses, some boars, some Piśācamouthed animals and some embracing the Pannagas. And other night-rangers, having their bodies sundered by the deities gave up their being. The Rakşasas being slain and lying down on earth the action appeared wondrous like a painting.
There issued out in the battle-field a river from weapons, having blood for its silent waters and infested with crows and vultures.
Having beheld his own army slain by the deities the highly powerful Daśänana, enraged beholding the army slain by gods, entered the ocean of celestial army and slaying the deities in the conflict confronted Sakra.
Thereupon Śakra took up his huge bow by the twang where-of the ten quarters were filled.
Having unstrung his huge bow Indra struck Răvaņa, on his head, with arrows resembling the flame of fire and the rays of the sun.
And the Rākşasa-chief Daśānana, having long arms, also assailed Indra with hundreds of shafts discharged off his bow.
They having been thus engaged with each other with the downpour of dreadful shafts, all the quarters were filled with darkness and in consequence thereof nothing was visible.
Then as the mighty king was lying down in this unbeseeming and improper guise, like Yayāti dropped from the celestial, that lady, personating the ruin of the race, not fearing public odium, who had discerned danger from Rāma to Bharata, not having attained her wish, again addressed the monarch, concerning the boon he had promised to her.
You describe yourself, O mighty monarch, as speaking the truth and firm in vow. Why then do you hesitate to confer this boon on me?
Thus addressed by Kaikeyi king Dasaratha, remaining stupefied for a while thus answered her in wrath.
O ignoble one! O enemy of mine! On my being dead and that chief of men, Rāma, repairing to the woods, do you, yours wish attained, become happy.
When in heaven, questioning me as to Rāma's welfare, the celestials, learning of his banishment to the woods, will tax me on this score, how shall I also bear that reproach of theirs?
If I shall truthfully say I have sent Rāma to the woods for compassing Kaikeyi's pleasure, that will count for a falsehood.
Sonless first, I have obtained the exceedingly energetic and mighty Rāma by great pain, how can I then renounce him?
How shall I banish Rāma having eyes resembling lotus' petals, who is heroic, and accomplished and of subdued anger, and forgiving.
How shall I dismiss to Dandaka the charming Rāma of dark blue hue like that of a blue lotus, possessed of mighty arms, and having great strength?
How shall I behold the intelligent Rāma in evil plight, who has never known suffering, and has always enjoyed felicity?
If without inflicting injury upon Rāma, I meet with death, I shall then attain happiness.
O cruel Kaikeyi, O you of evil purpose, why do you do this wrong to my beloved Rāma having truth for prowess? If I banish Rāma, an unparalleled obloquy will surely darken (my fair fame).
As king Dasaratha was bewailing thus with a heart wrought up with grief, the sun set and night came on.
But although crested with the lunar disc, the night failed to bring comfort to the king, distressed, and indulging in grief.
Then the old king Dasaratha, with his eyes fixed at the sky, sighing hot, lamented in this strain.
O night studded with stars, I beseech you, let not the morning appear. Do you, O gentle one, do me this kindness. I do thus clasp my hands (by way of supplication.)
Or do you speedily repair for I do not wish to see the hated and relentless Kaikeyi, who has brought this calamity upon me.
Having spoken thus, the kind conversant with the duties of Sovereigns again endeavoured to propitiate Kaikeyī, saying.
O noble dame, do you show favour to me, who am of honest ways, who am distressed, who have made myself yours, who have finished his life, and who, in especial, am your king.
That I have spoken you thus was because, O you of shapely hips, I had been deprived of my senses (through grief). O girl, do you show your favour to me, be generous, be propitious.
Let my Rāma obtain the kingdom in fact conferred by you. Thereupon, O you having the outer corner of your eyes of dark blue hue, you will attain high fame (among men.)
O you of well-developed hips, do you do this act of benefit to me and Ráma and the people and the superiors, and Bharata.
Having heard the exceedingly piteous words of her husband, the king of pure sentiment, who was distressed, with his eye rendered coppery and flowing with tears, that wicked minded and merciless woman spoke not.
Thereat seeing that his favourite dissatisfied wife persisted in urging the banishment of his son, the king struck with grief, again fell down to the earth, senseless.
As the wise king afflicted with sorrow was sighing hot and hard, the night passed away Then as the eulogists attempted to sung his praises for awakening him, he prohibited them to do so.
Hearing those sorrowful words of the Brāhmaṇa, Rāma was greatly sorry and sent for Vasistha, Vamadeva, his brothers, citizens and councillors.
There upon having entered the apartment in the company of Vasiştha, eight Brāhmaṇas blessed the king Rāma, resembling a celestial, saying 'may victory crown you.'
Markandeya, Maudgalya, Vamadeva, Kashyapa, Katyayana, Javali, Gautama, and Nārada, these eight leading Brāhmaṇas having takes their seats, Rāma with folded hands, saluted them. And he showed due civilities towards his minister, citizens, Rșis and all others. There upon all the highly effulgent Rșis being accommodated with seats Råma narrated duly before them the account of the Brāhmaṇa and said. This Brāhmaṇa is waiting at the Palace-gate.
Hearing those words of the poorly king, Narada, in the presence of all other Rsis, replied.
Hear, o king, why this boy has met with untimely death. And hearing this, O descendant or Raghu, do you settle what you think proper.
O king, in the golden age, only the Brahmanas used to engage in asceticism. At that age save the Brāhmaṇas no other caste used to lead the life of an anchoret.
And for this, the Brāhmaṇas were the highest caste, effulgent in asceticism, asceticism, shorn shorn of ignorance, above death and conversant with three ages.
There upon at the end of the golden age, Brāhmaṇa's understanding became loose and the Tretā Yuga set in. At this age Kşatriyas, gifted with the power acquired by pristine asceticism, were born. And those men, intent upon austere penances, that were born in the Tretā age, were more powerful and greater devotees than those in the former age.
In the golden age the Brāhmaṇas were more powerful than the Kșatriyas. But in the Tretā age the Brāhmaṇas and the Ksatriyas were equally powerful.
Thus in the Tretā age, not beholding prominence of the Brāhmaṇas greater than that of the Kşatriyas, Manu and other religious leaders of the time composed the Sastra describing and setting in the four divisions of castes.
In this wise the Tretā age was prolific with virtues of the four Varņas, and many pious sacrifices and was shorn of iniquities. But being attacked a little with iniquity, one portion of sin appeared on earth. And growing impious people of sin appeared on earth. And growing impious people lost their strength.
And for houses and farms that were the property of the former age, people of the Tretā Yuga were possessed by envy, the outcome of the quality of darkness. And with the treading of impiety on earth during Tretā, the soiled sin of untruth appeared. And this iniquity stretching one footstep, the lease of people's lives, for sins, became limited.
And the sin of untruth descending on earth, people, to a void the extinction of life in consequence thereof, became truthful and engaged in many pious observances.
During the Tretă age the Brāhmaṇas and Kș atriyas engaged in austere penances and the Vaiśyas and Sūdras engaged in serving them.
And the greatest piety of the Vaiśyas and Śūdras at that time consisted of serving the Brāhmaṇas and Ksatriyas and specially for the Śūdras the highest religion was to serve people of all Varnas.
O foremost of kings, at the end of the Tretă age, Vaiśyas and Śūdras being fully overpowered by the sin of untruth, the Brāhmaṇas and the Kșatriyas also grew feeble.
And the second foot of impiety being ushered into the world the Dvāpara age set in.
O foremost of men, during this age two legs of piety being cut off, impiety and untruth multiplies.
And in Yuga named Dvāpara the Vaisyas engaged in devout penances. In this wise in three ages the three Varnas gradually engaged in ascetic performances.
The piety of asceticism by Yugas gradually became established in three Varmas, But, O foremost of men, in these three Yugas the Sūdras were not entitled to the virtues of devout penances.
O foremost of men, the degraded caste, the Śūdras, during your rege me, have engaged in austere penances. And in the Kali Yuga asceticism shall be established in the Sūdras.
O king, even in Davāpara, devout penances for Śūdras were considered as impiety, what to speak of the Tretāage. O king, one Śūdras, under the influence of vicious understanding, has begun devout penances within your kingdom. And for that reason this boy has met with death.
Calamity sets in that kingdom where a vicious-minded person commits an iniquity and that vicious wight and the king forsooth speedily repair to hell.
The king, who piously govern his subjects, receive the sixth portion of there study asceticism and good actions.
While the king is entitled to the sixth portion of everything why should he not fully protect his subjects? Therefore, O chief of men, do you bring all informations of your kingdom. And be then studious to repress vices wherever you shall find them.
And by that, O foremost of men, the piety of the subjects shall be increased, the lease of their life shall be prolonged and this boy shall regain his life.
Then the spies communicated to Lankā's lord news concerning Rāghava and his host stationed at the mount Suvela.
Hearing the words of the spies, that Rama, accompanied by a mighty army, had arrived (there), Rāvana was a little agitated and spoke to Sardula.
Your colour has changed its natural aspect, and O ranger of the night, you look poorly. Did not come under the control of the wrathful foes?
Thus ordered by him, then (Sārdula), bewildered by fear, addressed that tiger of a Raksasa, saying.
Those powerful monkeys, o king, puissant, strong, and protected by Rāghava, are incapable of being ranged (by us). or
They cannot be conversed with interrogated. All around, the courses are kept by monkeys resembling hills.
As soon as I entered, and was scanning that host, I was discovered. And forcibly taken by the Rākşasa, I was pulled by them hither and thither.
And furiously assailed by the monkeys with thighs, clenched fists, teeth, and palms, I was dragged in the midst of the army by the enraged monkeys.
And, after having been taken all about, I was (at length) taken before Rāma, bleeding, with my limbs showing sorry work, and my senses swimming and paralysed.
And, having been belaboured by the monkeys, I, on craving his kindness with joined hands, was, at his pleasure, rescued by Rāghava, with, Don't, don't!
Having filled up the deep with rocks and crags, Rāma equipped with weapons, stay, occupying the gate of Lanka.
And, letting me off, that one of suspassing vigour, surrounded by monkeys, and, arranging his forces in the Garuda fashion, advance upon Lanka.
He draw nigh to the wall. Therefore, do one of these things in preference to the other, either render back Sītā, or give him battle.
Hearing this, Ravana, lord of Raksasas, then reflecting in his mind, spoke to Sārdula these pregnant words.
Even if the gods, Gandharvas, and Dānavas should array themselves against me, Sītā I shall not give, from fear of all creatures.
Having said this, that exceedingly energetic one again said,You have ranged this army. Who here among the monkeys are heroic?
O amiable one, what is their potency? And what are those monkeys that are hard to approach, like? And, O you of fair vows, whose sons and grandsons are they? Truly relate all this (to me).
Having ascertained their strength and weakness, I shall in this matter adopt my course. Those who wish for fight, certainly take account of all this.
Thus addressed by Rāvana, Sārdula—best of spies-thus began to speak in the presence of Ravana.
O king, that unconquerable one in fight, Jāmbavān, is well known as the son Gadgada, king of bears.
The other son of Gadgada is the son of Śakra's preceptor. By which son, single-handed, was done immense oppression to the Rākṣasa.
The righteous and puissant Sușeņa is the son of Dharma. And the mild monkey, Dadhimukha, O king, is the son of Soma. 1. Righteousness. 2. Moon.
And Sumukha, Durmukha and the monkey, vegadarcin (resembling) Death himself, were for certain begot by the Self-create in the shape of a monkey.* *Another meaning is, “The monkey, Vegadarsi who is death himself in the shape of a monkey." But I give the acceptable sense.
Nīla himself is the son of the bearer of sacrificial oblations;* and Hanumán is famed as the son of the Wind-god. * Fire.
The irrepressible and youthful Angada is the grandson of Śakra. And the lusty Mainda and Dvivida are sprung from Aśvi.
And five are the sons of Vaivasvata, resembling the Reaper himself, Gaya, Gavāks a, gavaya, Sarabha and Gandhamādana.
But I can not enumerate the rest, ten koțis of heroic monkeys-all sons of deities—burning for battle.
And this is Dasaratha's son—this you resembling a lion, who slew Düşana and Khara and Triſiras.
There breathes none on Earth that is like to Rāma in prowess, by whom was slain Virādha and Kabandha, resembling the Destroyer.
No person can on earth describe the virtues of Rāma; by whom have been slain all those Rākşasas that had gone to Janasthāna.
Here also is the virtuous Lakşmaņa, like to the foremost of elephants, coming in the way of whose shafts, even Vasava does not live.
And here are ſveta and Jyotirmukha, sprung from Vāskara's self; and the monkey Hemakūta is the son of Varuna.
The heroic Nalabest of monkeys, is the son of Viśvakarmă. And powerful and impetuous, Durdhara is the son of Vasu.
That foremost of Rāksasas, Vibhisana, your brother, engaged in the welfare of Raghava, has laid seige to Lankā.
Thus have I described to you the entire monkey host stationed in mount Suvela. As for what remain to be done, you are the master.
Hearing those words of the intelligent Kusanābha, his hundred daughters touching his feet with their heads, said,
O king, that life of all, the Air, was desirous of overcoming us, having recourse to an improper way; nor did he regard morality.
We have a father, good betide you; and we live at ease. Do you ask our father about it, if he consent conferring us on you.
But that wicked wight did not listen to our words; and as we were saying this, were we roughly handled by him.'
Hearing those words of theirs, the highly pious and puissant king addressed his hundred beautiful daughters, saying
You have displayed a signal example of that forgiveness which is fit to be followed by the forbearing; and that you have unanimously regarded the honour of my house, also conduces to your praise.
Alike to men and women, forbearance is an ornament. And difficult it is for one to exercise that forbearance, specially in respect of the celestials. And may every descendant of mine possess forbearance like to yours!
Forbearance is charity; forbearance is truth; forbearance, O daughters, is sacrifice; forbearance is fame; forbearance is virtue, you, the universe is established in forbearance;
Then dismissing his daughters, the king endowed with the prowess of celestials, and versed in counsel, began to consult with his counsellors about the bestowal of his daughters, in respect of time and place and person and equability of lineage.
It came to pass that at this time, an ascetic named Culi, highly effulgent, with his vital fluid under control, and of pure practices, was performing Brāhma austerities.
And as the saint was engaged in austerities, good betide you, Urmila's daughter named Somada-a Gandharvi-ministered to him.
And in all humility that virtuous one for a definite period was engaged in ministering to him. And thereat, her spiritual guide was gratified with her.
And, O descendant of Raghu, once he said to her, I am gratified, good betide you! What good shall I render you?
Thereupon, concluding that the ascetic was gratified, the Gandharvi, cognizant of words, exceedingly delighted, sweetly addressed that one versed in speech.
You are furnished with the Brāhma marks, art sprung from Brahmă, and art of mighty austerities. I desire of you a righteous son endowed with the Brāhma ascetic virtues.
I am without a husband, good betide you, and I am no one's wife. Upon me who is your servant you should confer such a son by help of Brāhma means.
Thereupon, well pleased with her, Cūlina conferred upon her an excellent Brāhma mindbegotten son, named Brahmadatta,
And that king, Brahmadatta, founded the flourishing city of Kampilya, even as the sovereign of the celestials founded the celestial regions.
And, O Kākutstha, the righteous king Kusanābha finally decided on conferring his hundred daughters upon Brahmadatta.
And inviting Brahmadatta, that highly energetic lord of earth, with a glad heart conferred his hundred daughters upon him.
And O descendant of Raghu, king Brahmadatta resembling the lord himself of the celestials, by turns received their hands in marriage.
And as soon as he touched them, the hundred daughters were cured of their crookedness, and became free from anguish, and were endowed with pre-eminent beauty.
And upon beholding them delivered from (the tyranny of) the Air, the monarch Kušanābha became exceedingly delighted, and rejoiced again and again.
And he dismissed that lord of earth, king Brahmadatta, in company with his consorts and the priests.
And the Gandharvī Somadā rejoiced exceedingly at the completion of the nuptials of her son; and embracing her daughters-in-law again and again, and extolling her son, she expressed the fullness of her joy. And he dismissed that lord of earth, king Brahmadatta, in company with his consorts and the priests.
And the Gandharvī Somadā rejoiced exceedingly at the completion of the nuptials of her son; and embracing her daughters-in-law again and again, and extolling her son, she expressed the fullness of her joy.
Those heroes, Rāma and Laksmana, their interest secured, with glad hearts passed that night there.
And when the night had passed away and the morning come, they together appeared before the saint, Visvāmitra, and the rest.
And having saluted that foremost of ascetics resembling flaming fire, your addressed him in gentle and honied accents.
These servants of yours, O best of ascetics, have come before you. Do you command, O chief of anchorites, what command of your are we to execute
Thus addressed by them the Maharșis with Viśvāmitra at their head spoke to Rāma, saying,
A highly meritorious sacrifice, O foremost of men, is to be celebrated by Mithila's lord, Janaka. Thither shall we repair.
And you, O tiger among men, men, must accompany us, and there behold a wonderful jewel of a bow.
And formerly this bow of immeasurable energy, and dreadful, and exceedingly effulgent at the sacrifice, had been conferred in court by the celestials (on king Devarata.)8
And neither gods nor Gandharvas, neither Asuras nor Rākşasas nor men, can fix the string upon it.
And desirous of being acquainted with the prowess of this bow, many kings and princes came; but they in spite of their mighty strength, failed in stringing it.
There, O Kākutstha, you will behold that bow belonging to the high-souled king of Mithila, as well as his exceedingly wonderful sacrifice..
That rare bow, O foremost of men, furnished with an excellent device for griping it, had been solicited by Mithila's lord as the fruit of his sacrifice; and the celestials conferred it upon him.
Now, O descendant of Raghu, in the residence of the king, the bow is worshipped like a deity with agaru dhüpa, and various other incenses.
This having been said, that foremost of ascetics, in company with Kākutstha and the saints, departed.
And on the eve of setting out, he addressed the sylvan deities, saying, Luck! I will, with my desire obtained, go from forth this Siddhāśrama to the Himavat mountain on the north of the Jahnavi.
Having said this, that tiger-like ascetic, Kusika's son, along with other anchorets having asceticism for their wealth, set out in a northerly direction.
And as that best of ascetics proceeded, he was followed by Brāhmaṇas, unholding the Veda, carrying the sacrificial necessaries on an hundred cars.
And birds and beasts dwelling in Siddhāśrama followed the high-souled Viśvāmitra having asceticism for wealth.
Having proceeded a long way, when the sun was sioping down, the ascetics rested on the banks of the Soņa. And when the maker of day had set, having bathed and offered oblations to the fire those ascetics of immeasurable energy, placing Viśvāmitra in their front, sat them down. And Rāma also together with Sumitrā's son, having paid homage to those ascetics, sat him down before the intelligent Viśvāmitra.
Then Rama of exceeding energy, influenced by curiosity, asked that foremost of ascetics, Viśvāmitra, having asceticism for his wealth, saying, 'O worshipful one, what country is this, graced with luxuriant woods? I am desirous of hearing this Good betide you, it behove you to tell me this truly.
Thus addressed by Rāma, that one of high austerities and excellent vows began in the midst of the saints to describe the opulence of that region.
Hearing these unpleasant words like to death, Rama, the destroyer of foes, was not pained, and spoke thus to Kaikeyī.
Be it what you say; carrying out the promise of the king, I shall repair to the forest from this place wearing bark and matted hair.
Now I want to know only why that lord of the earth, invincible and the conqueror of foes, does not receive me in the same way as he used to do on previous occasions.
be not angry, Oh worshipful one, I speak before you, be you propitiated well, and I shall go to the forest wearing bark and matted hair.
What is there that I cannot perform, considering it good without suspicion, if I am ordered so by my well-wisher, spiritual leader, father and king, who acknowledges your service (rendered in time of danger).* *The epithet Krtajñena may as well as be rendered into general terms; such as 'who acknowledges services rendered to him.' Here in translation I have followed the commentator who has restricted it to the special sense suitable to the occasion.
But this one sorrow burns my heart, why king did not tell me personally of the installation of Bharata.
What of the command of the king, my father, I shall even at your mandate joyfully make over to Bharata, my kingdom, Sītā, wealth and even my life, thereby satisfying you, and fulfilling my promise.
Do you now console the bashful king; why has he, with his eyes steadily fixed on the ground, been shedding tears slowly?
Let messengers, with fast going steeds go today at the command of the king to fetch Bharata from his maternal uncle's house.
I shall, not even judging the propriety of my father's words, speedily repair to the forest of Dandaka for fourteen years.
Hearing those words of Rāma, Kaikeyi was pleased, and being certain about his departure, hurried on Raghava.
Let it be that messengers with fast going steeds shall go to bring Bharata from his maternal uncle's residence.
I do not think it proper for you, O Rāma, to delay, when you are so anxious; it behoves you therefore to depart from this place speedily to the forest.
The king being abashed, does not himself address you, there is nothing else than this. Do you, Oh best of men, dispel this wretchedness of his.
As long as you shall not hurriedly depart from his presence, Oh Rāma, your father shall not bathe, or eat anything.
'Oh fie!' 'what affliction' sobbing hard with these words, the monarch, filled with sorrow, swooned away and fell down upon the sofa, embellished with gold.
Raising the king up, Rāma, being directed by Kaikeyī, began to hurry on his departure to the forest, like to a steed struck sharp with a whip.
Hearing those cruel and unpleasant words of the wicked Kaikeyi, Rama, not being distressed, began to address her with the following words.
Oh worshipful one, being addicted to wealth do I not long for living in this world; like to Rșis, know me, to be well established in pure religion.
If I can, even at the sacrifice of my own life, satisfy my worshipful father, rest assured it is to be done first in all manner.
There is no virtue greater than the serving of the father and carrying out his words.
Even though not commanded by him, I shall, for your words, live in a solitary forest for fourteen years.
Oh Kaikeyī, certain it is that you are not acquainted with my foremost virtues, inasmuch as possessing full authority to rule me, you have requested the monarch for this.
Excuse me until I ask my mother, and comfort Sītā; even this very day shall I wend my way to the great forest of Dandaka.
If behoves you to do that by which Bharata may govern the kingdom and tend our father, for this is the virtue eternal.
Hearing these words of Rāma, his father, greatly afflicted and incapable of speaking anything on account of sorrow, began to cry aloud.
Worshipping the feet of the king lying insensible, and those of vicious Kaikeyi, that greatly effulgent one went out.
And reverentially going round his father and Kaikeyi, and issuing out of the female apartment, Rāma saw his own friends and relatives.
Then followed him Lakşmaņa, the enhance of Sumitra's joy, greatly angry and with his eyes full of tears.
Going round with reverence the house of installation full of necessary articles, not turning away from it his wistful look, Rāma began to proceed slowly.
Loss of kingdom could not diminish the great beauty of that beloved of the people on account of its everlasting pleasantness, like to the wane of the moon.
There was manifest in his no change of mind, who was about to fly as an exile to the forest and leave the world, like to one emancipated while yet living.
Leaving aside the excellent umbrella and well adorned chowries, forsaking his relatives, chariot, citizens and other people, calmly bearing the affliction in mind and not manifesting the outward signs of sorrow, Rāma, with a view to communicate this unpleasant news to his mother, entered her abode.
All persons, who were present there and who adorned themselves on account of the installation, did not perceive any sign of mental agony on the face of Rāma.
Like to the rays of the fully brilliant autumnal moon, that hero of mighty arms, having control over himself, did not forsake his native cheerfulness.
The pious Rāma, having high fame, entered into the presence of his mother, manifesting great regards for the people with sweet speech.
Then followed him, the son of Sumitrā, of mighty prowess, of equal accomplishments with his brother, and bearing the mental sorrow. Rāma, entering the abode of his mother.
Saw it filled with all sorts of amusements; and even though his mind was not agitated with any mental disturbance seeing the impending calamity of loss of wealth, he was anxious lest the lives of his dear relatives mighty be in danger.
And to Khara deprived of his car standing with a mace in his hand, that exceedingly energetic one, Rāma, precluding his speech with mildness, spoke.
Backed by this mighty host abounding in elephants and horses and cars, you have done an exceedingly wicked deed, execrated by all the worlds. Even if one happen to be the lord of the three worlds, one given to troubling creatures, and who is cruel and engaged in wicked acts, can not exist. All persons destroy, like a snake that has intruded itself, him that dose cruel deeds, hostile to the interests of every one.
People delightedly behold the end of him that doing an action either from covetousness or desire, dose not like a Brāhmaṇi swallowing a Karakā, see the consequence thereof.
What, O Rākṣasa, do you gain by slaughtering exceedingly pious ascetics engaged in righteous acts, living in the forest of Dandaka?
Like to trees whose roots have been reduced, cruel persons, execrated of men, who perpetrate iniquitous acts, do not exist long.
As a tree puts forth blossoms in season, the doer of sinful deeds, at the hour (of repentance) inevitably reaps their fruit in the shape of dreadful anguish (of the spirit).
O ranger of night, as the effect of having taken rice mixed with poison, appears without delay, even so also people readily reap the fruit of their own acts.
O ranger of the night, it is to take the lives of the perpetrators of dreadful sins, who wish ill to men, that I the king have come.
Today the gold-decked arrows discharged by ine, piercing (your body), shall enter into the carth, cleaving it, like serpents falling into an ant-hill.
Slain in battle, you shall in company with your army, follow those people practising piety, whom you have devoured in the Dandaka forest.
Today let those great saints, who had formerly been slain by you, stationed in the sky, behold you slain (in turn) with my arrows, and inhabiting hell.
Do you strike as you like. And youl that are of an odious race, do you put forth your energy. Today I will bring down your head, even as a palm falls to the ground.
Thus addressed by Rāma, Khara enraged and beyond himself with passion, with eyes reddened, replied.
O son of Dasaratha, why having slain inferior Rākṣasas in battle, do you praise yourself without reason?
Those foremost of men that are puissant and powerful, do not, inflated with their energy, mouth (their own consequence).
It is the mean-minded Kșatriyas of impure hearts that magnify themselves among men, even as you, O Rama,do.
What hero, when the hour of his death has approached, publishes in the field his own lofty lineage and sings his own hymn.
As brass wearing the semblance of gold, displays its own defect on being heated*, with a fire lit with Kusa, so you have betrayed your own lightness by this speech of yours. i.c. becomes dusky, (Ramanuja).
You do not see me staying here mace in hand, like a moveless mountain dyed in metals, bearing mobile and immobile things.
I can, mace in hand, deprive you and the three worlds to boot clean of your lives, like the very Destroyer with the noose in his hand.
But I will not parley much with you as much as I could wish: the sun is going to set, and our fight shall be interrupted.
Fourteen thousand Räksasas have been slaughtered by you. I will for their deaths wipe their tears to-day.
Saying this Khara, highly enraged, hurled his mace+ provided with golden rings at Rāma, like to the blazing thunderbolt. Another reading is, plaited with gold.
Thereat, reducing to ashes trees and shrubs, that mighty flaming mace, discharged by Khara's arm, fell before Rama.
And Rāma severed in many fragments that mighty mace, resembling the noose of Death, as ascending the welkin, it was coming down.
Thereupon, like a she-serpent brought down by force of incantations, the mace fell to the earth shattered and riven.
Having thus directed his brother, the highly energetic son of Raghu equipped himself with his gold-hilted scimitar.
And girding himself with his bow bent at three places, which served him ornament,—as well as a couple of quivers, that one of fierce energy sallied out.
Seeing that foremost of monarchs approach, that best of beasts from fear disappeared; and then again showed himself. as an
Thereat girt with the bow and sword, (Rāma) rushed where the deer was; and beheld him illumining all before him with his beauty, and bow in hand (Rāma beheld) him in that vast forest, darting away after gazing at him,-and sometimes seeming to have got beyond arrow range, and at others tempting Rāma (by his vicinity). And sometimes influenced by fear and bewildered, (the deer) seemed to course the welkin; and in the forest now he became visible and now vanished from sight. And like the autumual lunar disc enveloped by indented clouds, he momentarily showed himself, and anon discovered himself at a distance.
And Mārica wearing the shape of a deer, showing himself and disappearing from sight, drew Rāghava a long way from the hermitage.
Thereat Rāma, eagerly anxious to secure the deer, being foiled by the deer, and in consequence growing enraged, wearied out, rested under a shadow, on a sward.
And that ranger of the night, wearing the form of a deer, maddening Rāma, discovered himself (again) at a distance surrounded by (other) deer,
And Rama desirous of taking (the beast), seeing him again, set off at speed. At the very moment the deer disappeared from fear,
And again showed himself at a distance behind a tree. And seeing him, the exceedingly energetic and strong Rāghava, determined to slay him, growing wroth, taking out a flaming shaft, resembling the rays of the sun, powerfully drew his bow, and firmly setting the shaft, and aiming it at the deer, let go the blazing and burning weapon forged by Brahmā, resembling a flaiming serpent.
And that best of arrows, like to a thunderbolt, deeply pierced the breast of Mārīca, wearing the shape of a deer.
Thereat bounding up high as a palmyra palm, that one whose saws had almost run out, uttered terrible sounds, lying on the earth.
And while on the point of death, Mārīca renounced his counterfeit shape. And remembering the words of Rāvana, the Rākşasa reflected, by what means can Sītā send away Lakşmaņa, and Rāvana carry off Sītā staying in solitude?
And pierced to the marrow by that peerless shaft, Marica, renouncing his deer form, resumed his Rākşasa lineaments; and giving up his life attaining a huge person, considering the time had come (for availing himself of the advice tendered by Rāvana), began to cry with the voice of Rāghava, Ah Sita! Ah Laksmana!
And seeing that grim-visaged Rākşasa lying low on the ground, with his person bathed in blood, and rolling hither and thither, Rāma proceeded towards the asylum thinking of Sītā and revolving within himself Laksmana's words.
While returning he thought Mārīca aside Lakş mana said before that this was Mārica's illusion! His words have been verified now. Truly have I killed Mārīca.
Mārīca has given up his ghost exclaiming aloud Ah! Sītā, Ah! Laksmana. I do not know what shall Sītā do hearing the cry? And what shall the mighty-armed Laksmana do?
While pondering thus the hairs of the virtuous-souled Rāma stood on their end. Killing that Räkşasa assuming the shape of a deer and hearing his terrible cry Rāma was overwhelmed with fear arising out of sorrow.
Thereupon killing a deer and taking its flesh he hastened towards Janasthāna.
Beholding Maithili standing humbly by him, Räma began to give vent to his pent-up feelings.
O gentle one, destroying all the enemies in the arena of battle I have subdued your enemy-I have done all that can be accomplished by manliness.
I have reached the other end of my anger, rubbed off (the insult) for my spouse being taken away by the enemy and have killed simultaneously my disgrace and enemy.
My manliness has been displayed today, my laboúr has been crowned with success and today I have fulfilled my promise by my own prowess.
That accidental misfortune, under the influence where of you were carried away by the fickle-minded Räksasa in my absence, has been subdued today by me, a man.
What is the use of his manliness, who when insulted, cannot remove it? Even if he be a great man he may be called mean.
The praise-worthy works of Hanumān-the crossing of the deep and the devastation of Lankā, have been crowned with success today.
The labour of Sugrīva with his army, who displayed valour in the encounter and gave me good counsels, has borne fruit today.
Today also the labour of Vibhişaņa has borne fruit-who renouncing his brother, devoid of all good Qualities, came to my side.
Hearing those words of Rāma, Sītā began to look wistfully like a hind, with eyes full of tears.
Beholding his beloved spouse near him and afraid of popular ignominy his heart was broken into two.
Thereupon he spoke to the exquisitely beautiful Sītā, in the midst of the monkeys and Räkşasas, having eyes resembling lotus petals and black and curling hairs, saying.
As the southern quarter, incapable of being got at by the people, was conquered by the selfcontrolled great ascetic Agasty, so for you slaying Ravana, I (always) anxious to have honour, have removed my insult-as is the duty of a man.
May good betide you-do you know that all my labour in the battle-field, backed by the prowess of my friends, is for you.
To uphold the dignity of my well-known family, to remove the ignominy consequent upon your being stolen away as well as to wipe off my own insult I have encompassed this.
I have suspected your character; you, (Therefore) standing before me, are distressing me like to a lamp before one who is subject to an eye-desease.
Do you therefore proceed, O daughter of king Janaka, wherever you like to one of these ten quarters. I permit you, O gentle one. I have nothing to do with you.
What powerful man, born in a high family, take back his wife considering her as friend out of lust, who has lived long in another's house?
You were taken by Rāvana on his lap, beheld by him with sinful eyes; how can I, taking you back, bring disgrace upon my great family?
The object, with which I have gained you back, has been accomplished. I have got no attachment for you-do you go wherever you wish, O gentle one.
I speak these to you impelled by my sense of duty. If you wish you may live with Laksmana, Bharatga or Satrughna or with Sugrīva or Räkş asa Vibhisana. Do you settle, O Sita, where you may find your own pleasure.
O Sita, (I do not think) Ravana has overlooked you, who lived in his house, beholding you so graceful and beautiful.
Thereupon hearing those unpleasant words from her beloved (husband) Sītā, always sensitive and who had never heard such unpleasant words, trembling like a creeper torn by the trunk of an elephant, began to weep shedding tears profusely.
Having thus described at length and finished the story of Vſtra's destruction Lakşmaņa said:-The mighty Vţtra, the terror of the deities, being slain, and the slayer Indra being assailed by the sin of Brahmanicide, was bewildered and at a loss to ascertain his duty.
Being at his wit's end he repaired to the other side of the Lokāloka mountain and remained there for some time like a coiled serpent.
And again in consequence of Indra's separation, the whole world was agitated, the forests grew dried and the earth was devoid of water. On account of the rivers being dried up and want of rain all creatures grew impatient.
In this wise, the celestials being stricken with anxiety, according to the previous command of Visnu, engaged in celebrating the sacrifice.
With Rșis and Rtvikas they fearfully approached Purandra; and beholding him assailed by the sin of Brahmanicide, they with him, at their head, engaged in celebrating a horse-sacrifice.
After the sacrifice the sin issued out of Indra's person and addressing the high-souled deities said: Do you all ascertain, where I shall go now. There upon highly pleased the deities replied: Do you divide yourself into four portions.
Hearing the words of the high-souled celestials she divided herself into four parts and wishing for a separate habitation said:-By one portion, I shall at my pleasure, live in rivers full of water during rains and shall obstruct people from going there.
By my second portion I shall live perpetually on lands as Uşara;* I tell you the truth. By my third portion I shall for three nights every month live in youthful women proud of their youth-So that men might not live with them. And by my fourth portion I shall enter into the persons of those who shall slay innocent Bråhmaņas. *(A spot with saline soil.)
Hearing those words the deities said What you have said shall be carried out. Do what you wish.
There upon the celestials, delighted, adored their Chief divested of sins and crowned with victory.
And Väsava being installed again on the throne, the whole universe was at rest. There upon Indra worshipped Vişnu in the shape of that wonderful sacrifice.
O descendant of Raghu, such is the power of a horse-sacrifice. O honourable king, therefore, you may perform this sacrifice.
Hearing the charming words of Lakşmaņa, the energetic and high-souled king, Rāma, powerful like Indra, was greatly delighted.
Having accepted those weapons with purity, Käkutstha while proceeding, with a complacent countenance spoke these words to sage Visvāmitra,-
O adorable one, I have received these weapons, incapable of being repressed even by the celestials themselves. Now, O best of ascetics, I would acquire a knowledge of with drawing them.
Upon Kākutstha's representing this, Viśvāmitra of high austerities, endowed with patience, of excellent vows, and pure in spirit, communicated to him the mantras for restraining the weapons.
Do you, O Rāma, accept Satyavat, and Satyakirti, Dhrsta, Rabhasa, Pratihāratara, Paranmukha, Avanmukha, and also Laksya, a Alakṣya, Dędhanabha, Sunābha, Sunabha, Dasaksa, Satavaktra, Dasasirsa, Satodara, Padmanabha, Mahanabha, Indunābha, Svanābha, Jyotisa, Sakuna, Nairasya, Vimala, Yaugandhara, Vinidra, and the two Daityapramathanas, and Śucibāhu, Mahābāhu, Niskali, Viruca, Arcimāli, Dhrtimali, Vrttimān, Rucira, Pitrya, Saumansa, Vidhuta, Makara, Karavīra, Rati, Dhana, and Dhānya, O Rāghava, and Kāmarūpa, Kāmaruci, Moha, Avarana and Jrmbhaka, Sarpanātha, Panthāna, and Varuņa-these sons of Kļśāśva, O Rāma, effulgent, and assuming shapes at will. And, good betide you, O descendant of Raghu, you are worthy to receive these weapons.
Thereupon, Kākutstha with heart overflowing with delight, said,-So be it! And those weapons were furnished with celestial and shining persons, and endowed with visible shapes, and capable of conferring happiness. And some of them were like (live) coals; and some comparable to smoke; and some were like to the Sun or the Moon. And with folded hands, they spoke to Rāma in honied accents; O chief of men, here we are! Do you command as to what we are to do on your behalf.
Then the descendant of Raghu answered, saying, Repair whither soever you will! Recurring to my memory, do you in time of need, render me assistance!
Thereupon paying homage to Rāma, and having gone round him, they replied to Kākutstha, What is yonder wood hard by the hill, appearing like clouds? Great is my curiosity.
It is pleasing to the sight, and abounds in beasts, and is exceedingly romantic, and is adorned with various birds singing sweetly.
Now, O foremost of ascetics, we have come out of a wilderness capable of making one's hair stand on end. And from the pleasantness attaching to this place, I have come to a conclusion.
Tell me, O reverend sir, whose hermitage is this? Have we, O eminent ascetic, reached that spot where dwell those wicked minded wretches of impious deeds, given to slaughtering Brāhmaṇas, who disturb your sacrifice? Where, O adorable one, is that hermitage, repairing to which, O Brahmana, I am to protect your sacrificial rites, and to slay the Raksasas? All this, O foremost of ascetics, I desire to hear, O lord.
Having sent away his friends and determined what to do, Rāma, the delight of the Råghus, commanded the warder, who was seated hard by, saying.
Do you bring in no time, Lakşmaņa, a son of Sumitrā, gifted with auspicious marks, alongwith great Bharata and the irrepressible Šatrughna.
Hearing the words of Rāma and placing his folded palms on his head the warder reached house of Lakşmaņa and unobstructed entered therein.
And having saluted him, with folded palms he said to the high-souled Laksmana and:-"The King wishes to behold you-do you soon go there.
Thereupon being apprised of Rāghava's command and saying 'so be it.' Saumitri ascended his car and went speedily towards Rāma's abode.
Having beheld Lakşmana's departure the warder humbly went to Bharata and having blessed him with folded hands said: “The King wishes to see you."
Hearing of the command of Rāma from the warder, the highly powerful Bharata at once got up from his seat and proceeded on foot.
Seeing Bharata's departure the warder speedily went to the mansion of Satrughna and with folded hands said.
"Do you come, O foremost Raghus, the King wish to behold you.” Lakşmaņa and Bharata are also there.
Hearing the words of the warder Satrughna lowered his head and rising up speedily proceeded to Rama.
Thereupon returning, the warder, with folded। hands, communicated to Rama, the arrivals of his brothers.
So long Rāma was engaged poorly in anxious meditation with his crown bent downwards. Informed of the princes' arrival he commanded the warder, “Do you soon bring the princes here. My life depends upon them. They are my dearest life.
Having obtained Rāma's command, the princes, clothed in white raiment, entered there, with folded palms and quiescent mind.
